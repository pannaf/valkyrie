To construct meaningful workouts, V needed to draw from a solid exercise list with a diverse set of movements. While this list could have been generated by prompting an LLM, doing so runs the risk of hallucination and lack of comprehensiveness. On the other hand, scraping credible fitness websites ensures accurate, relevant, and consistent information from domain experts.

I used [NeMo Curator](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Curator) to generate an exercise list with a pipeline that gathers, cleans, and processes web-scraped data.

#### Pipeline Overview

Following the NeMo Curator tutorial [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/curating-custom-datasets-for-llm-training-with-nvidia-nemo-curator/), my pipeline includes the following steps:

1. Download and Extract Data:
- `ExerciseDownloader` (custom): Downloads HTML from specified URLs that contain exercise lists.
- `ExerciseIterator` (custom): Splits the HTML content into individual records with metadata.
- `ExerciseExtractor` (custom): Extracts and cleans text content from HTML, removing unnecessary tags.

2. Clean and Unify Text:
- `UnicodeCleaner` (custom): Removes non-ASCII characters.
- `UnicodeReformatter` (direct NeMo): Standardizes Unicode formatting.

3. Filter the Dataset:
- `KeywordFilter` (custom): Removes irrelevant documents based on specific keywords.
- `WordCountFilter` (direct NeMo): Ensures documents meet a minimum word count, at least 1 word.

4. Deduplicate Records:
- `ExactDuplicates` (direct NeMo): Identifies and removes exact duplicate records.

5. Output the Results:
- Saves the final dataset in JSONL format.

#### Code
Refer to [src/datasets/nemo_exercise_downloader.py](src/datasets/nemo_exercise_downloader.py) for the full implementation.

#### A few notes
##### Installation
Installation on my Mac laptop was painful 😅. I did see in the GitHub Issues [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Curator/issues/76#issuecomment-2135907968) that it's really meant for Linux machines. But.. this didn't stop me from trying to install on my Mac anyway 🙃. After some trial and error, I landed on something that ultimately worked. `conda` with a Python 3.10.X version was clutch. Later versions of Python (3.11 & 3.12) didn't work for me. I'm not normally a fan of the `conda` bloat, but in this case the README of the NeMo text processing repo [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-text-processing) recommended it for the `pyini` install that `nemo_text_processing` needs. 

In case others find this helpful, I've got the following in my `~/.zsh_history` as the steps just prior to getting things working:
```zsh
➜ conda install -c conda-forge pynini=2.1.5
➜ pip install nemo_text_processing
➜ pip install 'nemo-toolkit[all]'
➜ cd NeMo-Curator # note I cloned the NeMo-Curator repo for this install
NeMo-Curator git:(main) ➜ pip install .
NeMo-Curator git:(main) ➜ brew install opencc
NeMo-Curator git:(main) ➜ export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/Cellar/opencc/1.1.7/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
##### NeMo Magic Sauce
I didn't get a chance to take full advantage of what I think is a key ingredient in the magic sauce for NeMo Curator. Namely the GPU acceleration that makes it possible to more efficiently process massive amounts of data. My exercise dataset doesn't really fall into that "massive amounts" category, so it wasn't super necessary to use in my case. But.. I think it would have been super fun to explore their multi-node, multi-GPU classifier inference for distributed data classification (example [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Curator/blob/main/docs/user-guide/DistributedDataClassification.rst)). Next time!

##### Experiments that didn't make the cut
I explored a couple aspects of NeMo Curator that I ultimately didn't get to use in my final system:
- Wikipedia data pull - one thing I found here is that I needed to set `dump_date=None` in `download_wikipedia()` in order to get [this example](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Curator/blob/main/examples/download_wikipedia.py) working
- Common data crawler - no insights to report.. [this example](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Curator/blob/main/examples/download_common_crawl.py) worked pretty well for me, just requires you to specify a reasonable directory

### Cleaning the `.jsonl` format a little
Normally I wouldn't include this type of detail, but I thought this was pretty neat and worth a quick share! My `.jsonl` files output from my NeMo Curator pipeline end up with this type of format:

```json
{"filename":"exercises-0.jsonl","id":"doc_id-04900","text":"Seated Barbell Shoulder Press","word_count":4}
{"filename":"exercises-0.jsonl","id":"doc_id-06200","text":"Dumbbell Goblet Squat","word_count":3}
{"filename":"exercises-0.jsonl","id":"doc_id-07500","text":"Curtsy Lunge","word_count":2}
```

I wanted to transform this into a simple text file that has just the text fields extracted. There's lotsa ways I could have done this in Python, but there's also this pretty sweet command line JSON processor `jq` for these types of things. Head over [here](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/jq) if you haven't heard of `jq` before. Here's the command:

```zsh
for file in exercises-*.jsonl; do
    jq -r '.text' "$file" > "${file%.jsonl}-text.jsonl" # pulls out the "text" field from each JSON line
done
```

Giving the output:

```text
Seated Barbell Shoulder Press
Dumbbell Goblet Squat
Curtsy Lunge
```

Exactly what I wanted 🙃

### Annotating Exercises with Attributes
To get the final list of exercises that V could use in workout planning, I took a few additional Human-in-the-loop steps:

1. Collaborated with ChatGPT to fill out an initial pass at annotating each of the ~1400 exercises with the following attributes: `Exercise Name,Exercise Type,Target Muscle Groups,Movement Pattern,Exercise Difficulty/Intensity,Equipment Required,Exercise Form and Technique,Exercise Modifications and Variations,Safety Considerations,Primary Goals,Exercise Dynamics,Exercise Sequence,Exercise Focus,Agonist Muscles,Synergist Muscles,Antagonist Muscles,Stabilizer Muscles`
2. Scanned through the ChatGPT annotations to correct any obvious mistakes.
   
The attributes provide the sufficient context needed for V to select appropriate exercises for a user, based on their fitness level and preferences.

### Answer Questions about V
I wanted to mix a little personality and fun into V with this little easter egg. Asking about V should invoke the "V Wizard" workflow that has a prompt that can provide some basic info about V 🙃

Initially, I found it extremely helpful to look at the traces in LangSmith to verify that V was actually persistently staying in the correct wizard workflow. I used it to help identify a bug in my state where I wasn't correctly passing around the `dialog_state`.

Example from when I had the bug:

<img width="720" alt="langgraph-debug-trace" src="https://github.com/pannaf/artemis/assets/18562964/11cdd753-7210-4356-a6bd-906f10011295">

Notice that in the trace, V doesn't correctly leave the primary assistant to enter the Goal Wizard.

Correct version:

I used NeMo Guardrails to apply checks on the user input message, as a way of ensuring V doesn't engage meaningfully with a user on topics that land in the medical domain where only a licensed medical professional has the requisite expertise.

### LangChain Integration
> Didn't work for me with LangGraph.

I attempted to follow [this NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails tutorial](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/guardrails/user_guides/langchain/langchain-integration.html) to integrate with my LangGraph agent with the `RunnableRails` class as:

```python
from nemoguardrails import RailsConfig
from nemoguardrails.integrations.langchain.runnable_rails import RunnableRails

# ... initialize `some_chain`

config = RailsConfig.from_path("path/to/config")

# Using LCEL, you first create a RunnableRails instance, and "apply" it using the "|" operator
guardrails = RunnableRails(config)
chain_with_guardrails = guardrails | some_chain

# Alternatively, you can specify the Runnable to wrap
# when creating the RunnableRails instance.
chain_with_guardrails = RunnableRails(config, runnable=some_chain)
```

With my LangGraph chain including a model with `.bind_tools()` I wasn't able to get this working in my time box. Instead, I added the guardrails in a LangGraph node, as described below.

### Standard `rails.generate()` in a LangGraph Node

What ended up working for me was to add a node at the top of my graph that does a check on the user messages, following the [Input Rails guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/guardrails/getting_started/4_input_rails/README.html) and the [Topical Rails guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/guardrails/getting_started/6_topical_rails/README.html). The node simply updates a `valid_input` field in the state, which is checked when determining which workflow to route to. When `valid_input` is `False`, V outputs the guardrails message and jumps to `END` to allow for user input.
